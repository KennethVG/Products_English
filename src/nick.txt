They call me The Wild Rose 
But my name was Elisa Day 
Why they call me it I do not know 
For my name was Elisa Day 

From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one 
She stared in my eyes and smiled 
For her lips were the colour of the roses 
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild 

They call me The Wild Rose 
But my name was Elisa Day 
Why they call me it I do not know 
For my name was Elisa Day
